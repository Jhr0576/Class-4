# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 4-hashes.rb

# Hashes are lists of *key-value pairs*

me = {"name" => "Jacob", "location" => { "city" => "Chicago", "state" => "Illinois" }, "status" => "student"}

# Accessing data from the hash

# puts me["location"]["state"]
# puts me["name"]
