# Booleans

# this_is_true = true
# puts this_is_true
# this_is_false = false
# puts this_is_false

# Boolean Expressions

# puts 3 != 2
# puts 3 > 2
# puts 3 < 2
# always use == for equals, as = is for variable assignment. == means is this true?

# If Conditional Logic

# if 3 == 2
# puts "hello!"

# if 3 > 2
# puts "hello!"
